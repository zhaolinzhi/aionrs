# Advanced Features

## Sub-Agent Spawning

The LLM can use the Spawn tool to create independent sub-agents that run tasks in parallel. Each sub-agent has its own conversation context, inherits the parent agent's runtime tool policy, and shares the parent agent's LLM provider (connection pool reuse). Fork-mode overrides can further restrict inherited tools but cannot restore tools denied to the parent.

### Use Cases

- "Search these 3 files simultaneously and summarize each"
- "Run tests and lint in parallel"
- "Search for X in the codebase while reading Y"

### Limits

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Max parallel sub-agents | 5 | Prevents resource exhaustion |
| Sub-agent max turns | 10 | Per sub-agent run turn limit |
| Sub-agent max tokens | 4096 | Per sub-agent response token limit |

### Behavior

- Sub-agents auto-approve all tool calls (no confirmation prompts)
- Sub-agents cannot exceed the parent agent's runtime tool policy
- Sub-agents do not save sessions
- Sub-agents run silently (no stdout output)
- All results are merged and returned to the parent agent

## Hook System

Event-driven hooks execute shell commands at specific points in the tool lifecycle, enabling auto-formatting, linting, auditing, and more.

### Hook Types

| Type | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| `pre_tool_use` | Before tool execution | Non-zero exit blocks the tool |
| `post_tool_use` | After tool execution | Non-blocking; errors are logged |
| `stop` | When agent session ends | Non-blocking |

### Configuration

```toml
# Auto-format Rust files after modification
[[hooks.post_tool_use]]
name = "rustfmt"
tool_match = ["Write", "Edit"]
file_match = ["*.rs"]
command = "rustfmt ${TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH}"

# Auto-format TypeScript files after modification
[[hooks.post_tool_use]]
name = "prettier"
tool_match = ["Write", "Edit"]
file_match = ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]
command = "npx prettier --write ${TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH}"

# Audit ExecCommand commands
[[hooks.post_tool_use]]
name = "audit-log"
tool_match = ["ExecCommand"]
command = "echo \"$(date): ${TOOL_INPUT_COMMAND}\" >> .aionrs/audit.log"

# Run lint on session end
[[hooks.stop]]
name = "final-lint"
command = "cargo clippy --quiet 2>&1 | tail -5"
```

### Environment Variables

Hook commands can reference these variables via `${VAR}` syntax:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TOOL_NAME` | Tool name |
| `TOOL_INPUT` | Full tool input JSON |
| `TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH` | File path (if the tool has a file_path parameter) |
| `TOOL_INPUT_COMMAND` | Command (if the tool has a command parameter) |
| `TOOL_INPUT_PATTERN` | Search pattern (if the tool has a pattern parameter) |
| `TOOL_OUTPUT` | Tool output (post_tool_use only) |

### Matching Rules

- `tool_match`: glob patterns matching tool names; empty = match all
- `file_match`: glob patterns matching file paths; empty = match all
- Default timeout: 30 seconds, configurable via `timeout_ms`

## Prompt Caching (Anthropic)

Prompt caching stores system prompts and tool definitions on Anthropic's servers, so subsequent requests only process the changed parts.

- **First request**: full input token cost + 25% write premium
- **Subsequent requests**: cached portion costs only 10%
- **Cache TTL**: 5 minutes (auto-renewed on each hit)

### Configuration

```toml
[providers.anthropic]
api_key = "sk-ant-xxx"
prompt_caching = true   # default true (Anthropic only)
```

### Token Stats

With caching enabled, stats show cache data:

```
[turns: 3 | tokens: 100 in (5000 cached) / 200 out | cache: 5000 created, 5000 read]
```

---

## VCR Recording & Replay

Record real API interactions and replay them in tests — no API key or network needed.

### Usage

```bash
# Record mode
VCR_MODE=record VCR_CASSETTE=tests/cassettes/my_test.json \
  aionrs -k sk-ant-xxx "Read Cargo.toml"

# Replay mode (in tests)
VCR_MODE=replay VCR_CASSETTE=tests/cassettes/my_test.json \
  aionrs "Read Cargo.toml"
```

### Features

- Auto-sanitization: sensitive headers (api-key, auth, token) are replaced with `[REDACTED]` during recording
- JSON-formatted cassette files, editable by hand
- Supports recording/replay of SSE streaming responses

---

## Logging

Structured JSON file logging with daily rotation, powered by the `tracing` crate. All internal events (LLM requests/responses, tool execution, MCP connections, compaction) are captured with structured fields.

### Enabling

Three ways to enable logging, from highest to lowest priority:

1. **CLI parameter**: `--log-dir /path/to/logs` (automatically enables logging)
2. **Config file**: add a `[logging]` section (global or project-level)
3. **Default**: logging is disabled unless explicitly configured

```bash
# CLI — logs to /tmp/aionrs-logs at debug level
aionrs --log-dir /tmp/aionrs-logs --log-level debug "Read Cargo.toml"
```

### Configuration

```toml
[logging]
enabled = true       # enable file logging (default: false; auto-enabled when dir is set)
level = "info"       # tracing filter directives (default: "info")
dir = "/path/to/logs"  # log directory (default: platform-specific, see below)
```

The `level` field accepts standard tracing filter directives:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `"info"` | Info and above for all targets |
| `"debug"` | Debug and above for all targets |
| `"aion_providers=debug,info"` | Debug for providers, info for everything else |

### Default Log Directory

When `dir` is not set, logs go to the platform-specific location:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Logs/aionrs/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/aionrs/logs/` or `~/.local/state/aionrs/logs/` |
| Windows | `{data_local_dir}/aionrs/logs/` |

### Log Format

Each line is a JSON object with structured fields:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-05-13T12:12:52.431Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"mcp server connected","server":"sentry","tools":20},"target":"aion_mcp","spans":[{"name":"agent_run","session_id":"abc-123","msg_id":"msg-456"}]}
```

Key fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `target` | Source crate (`aion_agent`, `aion_providers`, `aion_mcp`, etc.) |
| `spans[].session_id` | Session ID for correlating events within a conversation |
| `spans[].msg_id` | Message ID for correlating events within a single turn |

### Session Correlation

All events during `engine.run()` — LLM streaming, tool execution, compaction — are wrapped in an `agent_run` span carrying `session_id` and `msg_id`. This allows filtering all logs for a specific conversation:

```bash
# Find all events for a specific session
grep '"session_id":"abc-123"' 2026-05-13.aionrs.log | jq .
```

### Library Integration

When aionrs is used as a library (e.g. embedded in a backend server), the `create_file_layer()` API provides a composable tracing layer:

```rust
use aion_config::logging::{ResolvedLogging, create_file_layer};

let resolved = ResolvedLogging {
    enabled: true,
    level: "aion_agent=debug,aion_providers=debug".to_string(),
    dir: log_dir.to_path_buf(),
};
let (layer, guard) = create_file_layer(&resolved)?;

// Compose with your existing subscriber
tracing_subscriber::registry()
    .with(your_app_layer)
    .with(layer)  // aionrs logs → separate aionrs.log file
    .init();
```

The host application owns the global subscriber; aionrs library crates only emit tracing events and never initialize a subscriber themselves.

## AGENTS.md Hierarchical Loading

AGENTS.md files provide project-specific instructions that are automatically injected into the system prompt. Files are discovered hierarchically and merged from remote to near:

1. **Global**: `<config_dir>/aionrs/AGENTS.md` — user-level instructions for all projects
2. **Project hierarchy**: Walk up from cwd to the git root (or home directory), collecting every `AGENTS.md` found along the way

Files closer to the working directory appear later in the prompt and take precedence (via LLM recency bias). Each file is annotated with its absolute path for traceability.

### @include Directive

AGENTS.md files can include other files using `@` syntax:

- `@FILENAME` or `@./relative/path` — relative to the AGENTS.md file's directory
- `@~/path` — relative to home directory
- `@/absolute/path` — absolute path

Paths inside fenced code blocks are ignored. Includes are recursive (up to depth 5) with circular reference detection. Non-existent files and non-text files are silently skipped.

### Example

Given this structure:

```
my-workspace/
├── .git/
├── AGENTS.md          ← workspace rules
└── packages/
    └── server/
        └── AGENTS.md  ← server-specific rules
```

Running aion in `packages/server/` produces a system prompt containing both files, workspace first, then server.

## Memory System

Persistent, file-based memory that allows the agent to retain project-specific knowledge across sessions. Memory is automatically loaded into the system prompt at conversation start.

### Memory Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `user` | User's role, goals, preferences, knowledge |
| `feedback` | Corrections and confirmations on work approach |
| `project` | Ongoing work context not derivable from code/git |
| `reference` | Pointers to external systems and resources |

### Storage

Memory files live in a per-project directory under the global config:

```
<config_dir>/aionrs/projects/<sanitized-project-path>/memory/
├── MEMORY.md              # Index (auto-loaded into prompt, max 200 lines)
├── user_role.md
├── feedback_testing.md
└── project_auth_rewrite.md
```

Each memory file uses YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: auth rewrite
description: Auth middleware rewrite driven by compliance
type: project
---

Auth middleware rewrite is driven by legal/compliance requirements.
```

### Configuration

Memory is enabled by default with no configuration required. The memory directory is auto-resolved from the current working directory.

Override the base directory via environment variable:

```bash
export AIONRS_MEMORY_DIR=/custom/path
```

### How It Works

1. Agent starts → memory directory resolved from project path
2. `MEMORY.md` index loaded into system prompt (truncated at 200 lines / 25 KB)
3. Agent reads/writes memory files using standard Read/Write tools
4. Agent maintains the `MEMORY.md` index as memories are added or removed

---

## Plan Mode

A read-only exploration mode where the agent focuses on understanding the codebase and producing an implementation plan before making any changes.

### How It Works

1. Agent calls `EnterPlanMode` → tool access restricted to read-only (Read, Grep, Glob)
2. Agent explores code, designs approach, writes a structured plan in its response
3. Agent calls `ExitPlanMode` → full tool access restored, plan optionally saved to disk

### Configuration

```toml
[plan]
enabled = true                    # Register Plan Mode tools (default: true)
plan_directory = ".aionrs/plans"  # Where plan files are saved
# Optional: replace the built-in plan mode instructions text. When unset,
# aion_agent::plan::prompt::plan_mode_instructions() is used.
# prompt = "Your custom plan mode instructions here"
```

### Customizing the plan mode instructions

By default the system prompt gets a built-in plan mode instructions block
appended while plan mode is active. Hosts (e.g. AionUI) and CLI users can
replace this text in two ways:

1. **TOML config** — set `[plan].prompt` in `~/.aionrs/config.toml` or the
   project-level `.aionrs.toml`:

   ```toml
   [plan]
   prompt = """
   You are in plan mode. Restrict yourself to read-only tools. Produce a
   concise implementation plan and call ExitPlanMode when done.
   """
   ```

2. **CLI flag** — pass `--plan-mode-prompt <TEXT>` to override on a single
   invocation. The CLI flag takes precedence over the TOML value.

   ```bash
   aionrs --plan-mode-prompt "Only read files. Plan first, ExitPlanMode after."
   ```

When `prompt` is `null`/unset, the built-in default is used. The override
text replaces the built-in default **only** while plan mode is active — it
is never injected otherwise.

### Workflow Phases

When in plan mode, the agent follows a structured 4-phase process:

1. **Understand** — Explore the codebase with read-only tools
2. **Design** — Identify files to modify, code to reuse
3. **Write the plan** — Compose a clear, actionable implementation plan
4. **Submit** — Call `ExitPlanMode` to restore full tool access

## Context Compression

A three-tier automatic compaction strategy that prevents context window overflow during long conversations.

### Tiers

| Tier | Trigger | Method | LLM Call |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Microcompact** | Tool result count exceeds threshold or time gap | Clears old tool result content, keeping the N most recent | No |
| **Autocompact** | Input tokens approach context limit | LLM summarizes the conversation | Yes |
| **Emergency** | Input tokens near absolute limit | Blocks further API calls, asks user to start fresh | No |

### How It Works

- **Microcompact** runs automatically: replaces old Read/ExecCommand/Grep/Glob/Write/Edit results with `[Tool result cleared]`, keeping the 5 most recent results intact. Triggered by count (>10 compactable results) or time (>1 hour since last assistant message).

- **Autocompact** triggers when input tokens reach a threshold. By default this is `context_window - output_reserve - autocompact_buffer` (200,000 - 20,000 - 13,000 = 167,000 tokens). Alternatively, set `autocompact_threshold_pct` to trigger at a percentage of the context window (e.g. `50` = 50% of 200k = 100k tokens). The agent calls the LLM to produce a conversation summary, then replaces history with a compact boundary marker. A circuit breaker stops retrying after 3 consecutive failures.

- **Emergency** is the last safety net at `context_window - emergency_buffer` (default: 197,000 tokens). Always active regardless of config. Blocks API calls and prompts the user to compact or start a new conversation.

### Configuration

```toml
[compact]
enabled = true              # Enable compaction system (default: true)
context_window = 200000     # Context window in tokens
output_reserve = 20000      # Reserved for output generation
autocompact_buffer = 13000  # Buffer before autocompact triggers
emergency_buffer = 3000     # Buffer before emergency block
max_failures = 3            # Circuit breaker threshold
micro_keep_recent = 5       # Keep N most recent tool results
# autocompact_threshold_pct = 50  # Override: trigger at N% of context_window
```

---

## File State Cache

An LRU cache that tracks files the agent has recently accessed, enabling read deduplication and automatic cache updates on writes.

- **Read dedup**: When the agent reads a file it has already seen (and the file hasn't changed), the cache provides the content without re-reading from disk.
- **Write/Edit auto-update**: After Write or Edit operations, the cache is updated immediately with the new content.
- **Dual eviction**: Entries are evicted when either the entry count limit or the total byte size limit is reached.

### Configuration

```toml
[file_cache]
enabled = true                # Enable file state caching (default: true)
max_entries = 100             # Maximum cached files
max_size_bytes = 26214400     # Max total cache size (25 MB)
```

---

## Output Compaction

Post-processes tool output to reduce token usage. Three levels from lightest to heaviest:

| Level | Transformations |
|-------|----------------|
| `off` | No transformation |
| `safe` (default) | Strip ANSI escape codes, merge consecutive blank lines, collapse carriage-return progress bars |
| `full` | Everything in `safe`, plus: fold repeated lines, compact JSON indentation |

### TOON Encoding

When enabled alongside `full` compaction, TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) encodes uniform JSON arrays as compact tables:

```
[2]{id,name,role}:
  1,Alice,admin
  2,Bob,user
```

This is equivalent to:

```json
[{"id":1,"name":"Alice","role":"admin"},{"id":2,"name":"Bob","role":"user"}]
```

TOON instructions are injected into the system prompt so the LLM understands the format.

### Configuration

```toml
[compact]
compaction = "safe"   # off | safe | full (default: safe)
toon = false          # Enable TOON encoding (default: false)
```

### Runtime Control

In `--json-stream` mode, the compaction level can be changed at runtime via `set_config`:

```json
{"type": "set_config", "compaction": "full"}
```
